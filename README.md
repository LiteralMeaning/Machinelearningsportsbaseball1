# Machinelearningsportsbaseball1
Predicting with popular machine learning libraries in baseball. Winning teams, pennants, World series etc.

Brainstorm: Wanting to use some simple ideas, to get toward productivity and fun with machine learning +
data science + sports (baseball) = FUN FUN FUN

Using tools in the cloud, Amazon AWS, Floydub etc. and i believe that most of these tools have free options
so i will be using those first :):):):):)

1,2,3:

Would be the simple idea framework, SO: First find data, second find existing machine learning models (tune existing work, using cloud) on the web, google colab,github etc
and third, maybe get some interesting results, or any results ---- :):):):) ----- regarding predictions....Who will win the next World series etc....
